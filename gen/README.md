gen
===

This folder—excluding this `README.md` and the relatively-symlinked [`_lib`](../_lib) and [`app`](../app) directories—was completely generated by running, from one directory above this:

    $ ./create_installer_from_json.sh -f ./install.json -o gen

Which uses the [`install.json`](../install.json) file to create:

  - `Dockerfile`s
  - Environment files (`false_env.sh`; `env.sh`)
  - Install files (`install_gen.sh`; `install_parallel_gen.sh`)

## Gotchas

Because symbolic links don't work, you'll have to literally copy the directories over.

Make sure you have the latest folders in place; or delete the folders and `create_installer_from_json.sh` will do the copying for you.

For example, I usually run:

    $ rm -rf gen/{*.Dockerfile,*.sh,_lib,app} ; sh ./create_installer_from_json.sh -f ./install.json -o gen
    $ sh ./build_docker_images.sh -i gen -vvv
